Same reactors under blacklight

![](assets/README-a17d6e33.jpg)

Extracted GFP from reactors that has been polymerized under blacklight. Shaped using a 3D printed dogbone mold.


# Raspberry Pi Chemostat

![](assets/README-d1a1bf47.JPG)

Vessel Connected to the tower. Tower is 3D printed.

Progression of the reactor vessels. (Left to right) V1, V2 pint, V2 quart, and the chemostat vessel

# Bioprinter

![](assets/README-0fae1e54.jpg)

Bioprinter converted from a i3 clone. 3D printed syringe pump connected on the left side to pump viscous fluids instead of plastics.

Syringe pump was built following this paper. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067217300822

![](assets/README-7df9f339.png)

Glass dish adhered to bed, filled with a gelatin slurry for support of the printed item.

# Stand Alone Syringe Pump
