Some of the projects I have worked on, and the ones I am currently tackling.

## Mason Jar  Bioreactor V1
Created as part of the final project for my Instrumentation class

## Mason Jar Bioreactor V2

![](assets/README-0bb9f751.jpg)

Second reactor version utilizing an Arduino Uno for temperature control
 # Goals were:
 1. Sterilizable by autoclave
 2. Easily dissasembled for educational use
 3. Made from easily obtained parts
 4. Used to teach about microbiology, biochemical engineering, and electronics

Quart reactors with E. coli expressing different colors

![](assets/README-1e7e8f98.jpg)

Same reactors under blacklight

![](assets/README-a17d6e33.jpg)

Extracted GFP from reactors that has been polymerized under blacklight. Shaped using a 3D printed dogbone mold.


## Raspberry Pi Chemostat

# Goals
1. Maintain cells in their optimal growth phase by exchanging media
2. Measure Optical Density
3. Measure pH (optional control)
4. Sterilizable by autoclave
5. Web browser based control
6. Easily sourced parts

Progression of the reactor vessels. (Left to right) V1, V2 pint, V2 quart, and the chemostat vessel

## Bioprinter

![](assets/README-0fae1e54.jpg)

Bioprinter converted from a i3 clone. 3D printed syringe pump connected on the left side to pump viscous fluids instead of plastics.

Syringe pump was built following this paper. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067217300822

![](assets/README-7df9f339.png)

Glass dish adhered to bed, filled with a gelatin slurry for support of the printed item.

## Stand Alone Syringe Pump

![](assets/README-1bca026d.jpg)

## R. Palustrus Scale Up

## Current 3D Printer (Tevo Tornado)
![](assets/README-18da0f61.JPG)

## (Active Project) Syringe pump V2 (for bioprinter)
![](assets/README-dea94f38.JPG)
![](assets/README-f6f4ed5b.JPG)
# Goals
1. Reduce backlash from previously built pump
2. Allow for alternate syringe sizes
3. Belted drive reduction to reduce noise from 3D printed gears

## (Active Project) Building and learning how to use my Workbee 1010 CNC
